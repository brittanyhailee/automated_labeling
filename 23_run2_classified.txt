I wish I remembered more, but there were definitely some times this whole round, it was a bad time slot either because it just interrupted the TV show at a really odd time or it just didn't match the seriousness of the post-apocalyptic show, even though now that I'm thinking about it probably is for teenagers and they don't need to have serious insurance commercials or something.
