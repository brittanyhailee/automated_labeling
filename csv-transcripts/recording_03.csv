1,,0:15,0:28,um so the first starting at the begining um they were like throwing in the tv clip watermelons on something and they were talking in the diner 
1,,0:29,0:41,and then the commercial right after that i thought was in a good time slot because it they were like throwing things on the ground as well like computers and stuff
1,,0:42,0:44,um the guy was screaming a lot
1,,0:45,1:06,and um lets see in some of the other video clips um the one near the end one of the i think it was maybe her mother was dying or something and they had like family gathered in the hospital room
1,,1:08,1:29,um one of the commercials was about these like two women going through a store driving a shopping cart and rapping uh and lets see 
1,,1:29,1:46,there was a clip about um these two police officers talking um one was female and one was male the male was sitting down and he and they were talking about um what he was doing on his shift and whether he was using the patrol car
1,,1:47,1:54,and right after that i think there was um a car commercial so i thought that was a good time slot
1,,1:55,2:14,um there was a tv show clip about this family driving an RV down the road and they pulled up to a gas station and there was someone in the pump across from them and so when they pulled up the RV he said something to him 
1,,2:16,2:20,and um it went to a commercial after that 
1,,2:22,2:25,um what else 
1,,2:37,2:41,i think that might be all i can remember 
2,,,,okay so the very first tv show clip i think was from panam and it was um i think a flight attendant and some person in a suit sitting in a coffee shop um and they were talking 
,,,,and then the commercial right after it i dont remember what it was about but it was in a bad time slot
