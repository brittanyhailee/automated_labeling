1,corner-gas_s1-ep1_636-805_part1_resized_1280-720,0:34,1:03,um how much time do I have okay alright I remember starting with the show about the the uh small town where people were really hating on a legal office and throwing and throwing a lot of food stuff at it um there was a phone call left at the office um,,,
1,crazy-gideon_resized_1280-720,1:04,1:19,and I thought the commercial that came after which was about used electronics or electronics that were cheap was a good placement because the guy who was talking seemed very angry um ,,,
1,corner-gas_s1-ep1_636-805_part2_resized_1280-720,1:21,1:39,I think I saw two or three shows but there were a lot of repetitions of um the show with the gas station so there was a guy trying to put up pictures of uh or posters of films and his dad didn't like it um ,,,
1,the-riches_s1-ep1_2529-2659_part2_resized_1280-720,1:44,2:21,I don't remember the commercial that came after that uh then there was a scene of uh the show riches where everyone was in an rv and just waking up late in the morning and it looked like an introductory short where we saw all the characters in the rv and the dad was just filling up his um vehicle with gas and I think like some guy who knew him before from before stopped by in his own rv and mocked him or something ,,,
1,jp-audio-mart_resized_1280-720,2:23,2:39,um and then I think the commercial after that was about used cars and um it felt it felt like appropriate because we've been seeing a lot of vehicles from the previous clip um,,,
1,the-riches_s1-ep1_2529-2659_part1_resized_1280-720,2:43,3:13,in from the same show there was a clip of a very battered man who was still alive but the dad had been around or the cause of the accident and chose to grab like um a lot of pills from the back of the car instead of trying to help him and the man was holding some kind of object in his hand and I didn't know what that was but it looked important um,,,
1,horrible-insurance_resized_1280-720,3:14,3:29,I think after that there was maybe a commercial of uh people talking to each other over the cell phone so I didn't know if it was a cell phone ad or some kind of service are are you saying something ,,,
1,horrible-insurance_resized_1280-720,3:33,4:00,okay um it might have been earlier it might have been after the second clip but it was actually a bunch of insurance agents and um they were trying to show that insurance can be good I don't know and uh I thought it was well placed for the riches show where it's about conning people so I thought that was a good placement um,participant remembered the same clip but thought it was two separate clips,,
1,the-riches_s2-ep1_3244-3415_part2_resized_1280-720,4:02,4:36,"there was a clip of um a kid or maybe a teenager who had passed out and needed a doc a doctor's attention and he said that her condition was presumably because of a lot of drinking, and the mom was in denial about it um and embarrassed to admit to the doctor that she didn't know what was going on with the child and she looked angry at maybe her sister her mom or something who she perhaps thought was responsible ",,,
1,local-commercial-fail_resized_1280-720,4:37,5:00,"um, there was also a commercial with two girls in a car where they hear like a loud noise and it turns out to be a man dressed in an eagle suit who lays an egg when the chick comes out with either lottery or insurance card I didn't really know what it was um ",,,
1,filler_recall,5:04,5:07,trying to think if there were any other clips that I saw ,,,
1,corner-gas_s2-ep1_805-935_part2_resized_1280-720,5:09,5:51,there was one with like an out of town little girl in her car who was stopping by to get gas and was just trying to pay for it and get out of there but she had presumably had a lot of interactions with the people around the gas station and couldn't find anyone who worked there and by the time the guy who worked at came out she just left and uh the parents of that guy were fighting with each other because they wanted to spend money in different ways um yeah I think that's all I remember ,,,
2,panam_s01ep01_2310-2349_resized_1280-720,0:05,0:23,so the first clip was from the pan am show where a stewardess is sitting at a restaurant at a bar and a man was propositioning her in an inappropriate way and she just turned him down ,,,
2,panam_s01ep01_258-347_resized_1280-720,0:26,1:22,I can't remember the advertisement that came after that one but the next clip was also from pan am um it was in like one of the airport gates the stewardess was at the store at the gate and there were some magazines there I saw Harper magazine and another official looking person rich looking person was there um buying something else who got in her way and when I first saw that clip in the introduction section I thought that he was some kind of a smuggler but after reading the description it was clear that he was giving her like a bar of gold or something like that as CIA agent so that was the introduction,,,
2,take-my-wife_resized_1280-720,1:24,1:36,um and the clip after that it's harder to remember the ads but it might've been the one for the divorce lawyer maybe ,,,
2,popular_ep-04_1332-1502_part1_resized_1280-720,1:39,2:09,um and then there was that teenage show it was a group of girls in a a restroom and one of them was crying and just went into a stall by herself and the other one asked if she needed a bunch of drugs and ruled out prozac 'cause it takes a week to be active and uh the girl just wanted to be left alone so the other one went away,,,
2,filler_recall,2:12,2:17,um maybe I'll try to recall the ads after,,,
2,popular_ep-04_1332-1502_part2_resized_1280-720,2:20,3:38,then it went to another clip of the high school drama where a tall girl and a short girl who's wearing a scarf and had short hair were talking to each other and the tall girl felt like everyone was looking at her while they were walking in the corridor next to the lockers and it turned out that she was right she asked if there was something under her nose and were making and was making her really obvious or something and by the time she asked that question she saw that there was something profane written on her locker and a guy kind of um made fun of her for what was written alluding to the text written on the locker and then some guy who looked like a friend came up and told the tall girl that some other girl is looking for her and she ran to meet that other person and wasn't surprised that the other person was looking for her and the short girl was like I was busy yesterday what's going on and the friendly guy said that there was some kind of email scandalous email um that was causing the situation,,,
2,panam_s01ep02_746-831_resized_1280-720,3:40,4:20,those are the high school clips then there was a clip of a pilot or some kind of air force person and another stewardess wearing a white scarf and sunglasses in a fancy car without a roof and they had some kind of a bet which allowed the stewardess to take control of the car and the guy was just being very mistrustful willingly to drive and was trying to leave but and she just said we had a deal and asked for the keys and how fast the car goes and then just drove off into the sunset um,,,
2,cie-perfume_resized_1280-720,4:22,4:33,the ad after that one was some kind of a perfume ad um with just one blonde woman in it in a sensuous pose or something ,,,
2,panam_s01ep02_316-359_resized_1280-720,4:35,5:10,um then there was this another clip by from pan am where a stewardess um came in and immediately like she looked kind of flustered and asked for the manifest and she gravitated with this one seat or like a catch there was someone famous sitting there and then another friend of her's margot robbie came up and she pointed out who the famous person was I don't know it might have been the queen or something um ,,,
2,filler_recall,5:11,5:14,so that was the clip,,,
2,filler_recall,5:21,5:24,can't remember the ad for that one either ,,,
2,popular_ep-05_2131-2308_part1_resized_1280-720,5:25,6:01,then it went back to the high school show there was one clip of a bunch of popular girls coming over to another girl's house and saying happy birthday and then about four to five of them came together with like really heavy luggage for a sleepover and said happy birthday but then gave the birthday girl all her luggage and just went inside and then someone who looked like her friend came in the end and the birthday girl was actually happy to see her,,,
2,popular_ep-05_2131-2308_part2_resized_1280-720,6:02,6:32,"and then they were just um getting dressed for the night and having these like the girl who came at the end and the most popular one the mcqueen girl were having internal monologues about each other and what they were learning about each other from this interaction, and uh the birthday girl was just feeling sad that nobody really gave her a gift and were like just there to size each other up ",,,
2,henry-beer-commercial_resized_1280-720,6:32,6:50,and the ad after that one was a beer ad just on the beach where some guys were so drunk they thought some stationary objects were pretty girls so that felt like it matched you know like the atmosphere of the clip that came right before,,,
2,filler_recall,6:51,7:01,I'm gonna try to take a second to see if any ads come up but I'm not able to pair them very well um,,,
2,filler_recall,7:03,7:06,so there was the legal ad um ,,,
2,pay-me-now_resized_1280-720,7:11,7:19,there was some other ad about needing help but I don't remember which one it was um,,,
2,filler_recall,7:48,7:55,I think those are all the ads and clips I remember,,,
3,filmore_ep-7_236-406_part1_resized_1280-720,0:07,1:04,"so this run started with a clip from the animated show with the two children acting as cops, they were in the principal's office with her secretary it looked very presidential and she was describing everything in the school there was to be proud of and then she mentioned something that had been around for 4 years I had the impression it was some kind of a guinea pig or something or some kind of pet I don't know but everyone knew about and was going to be on national television but very recently it had gone missing so the principal was charging the two child cops to like investigate that for the rest of the episode um and then there was a nametag at the end of that clip um",,,
3,filler_recall,1:12,1:14,I'm trying to remember the ad after that one,,,
3,filmore_ep-7_236-406_part2_resized_1280-720,1:18,1:53,the ads were very memorable throughout the lock but it's hard to remember how they were paired but the subsequent clip was of um it just started where the previous one had left off cops so they were actually talking on someone's door um and maybe that kid's mom was in there and need to respond to the question of the two detectives she was just like you shouldn't be bothering yourself with such small issues ,,,
3,bang-bang-boom-boom_resized_1280-720,2:07,2:34,there might have been the the ad with like the thrift store with the directions for how to get there of the bypass with the bang bang and boom boom and it's hot jingle legendary advertisement and yeah it might have been there I'm not sure,,,
3,the-tribe_episode-1_1202-1332_part-1_resized_1280-720,2:35,3:10,then there was um the tribes show with uh the little kids in a playground like environment I think they were looking for some kind of a teddy bear or maybe the kid who's the owner of the teddy bear but yeah like they had like wild makeup um and those were the younger kids so they had a playground style situation lots of scribbles in the wall everyone was just playing and minding their own business,,,
3,the-tribe_episode-1_1202-1332_part-2_resized_1280-720,3:11,4:01,um the next clip was of older anarchist teenagers or something who were talking about their friends sacrificing themselves they had um lesser makeup than the kids in the previous clip they just had a black mark shaped like a tear going down their eyes and uh there were two teenagers in the backseat and they looked like maybe a couple and the guy was talking a lot and the girl was crying and the guy who was sitting the passenger seat at some point turned around and said something to anger the guy in the back seat who just got out of the car and just left and the engine was running the whole time um during that clip,,,
3,arrowhead-clinic_resized_1280-720,4:03,4:30,um oh yeah after the animated show there was that um 7790 pain 77906 pain ad for clinics or something like that I think it was after the first or second clip um,,,
3,filmore_ep-14_828-958_part1_resized_1280-720,4:33,5:30,the next clip was of uh the cop kids interrogating a guy who was like in a dance team or something with a girl who's wearing a green outfit and a ponytail and they were really all acting like adults it was a little bit disorienting but um ugh the the kid who was being interrogated was like wearing a wife beater and being accused of like hanging out with a bad crowd and the girl in green just said that oh the last time you messed up I just ignore it but this is too far and just ran away from the situation and the guy who was being interrogated wanted to chase after her and reassure her but the cop kids just were like you need to come with us and that's where the clip ended,,,
3,bowling_resized_1280-720,5:31,5:37,and after that there was the ad with the 99 cents bowling thing,,,
3,filmore_ep-14_828-958_part2_resized_1280-720,5:38,6:15,then there was another animated scene um animated the animated show where the girl in the ponytail and green was announcing her separation with her dance partner and making a case for taking new applications and it looked very public like she was standing at a podium and people were gasping in the audience it was almost like a press release or something and um the cop kids were just like what do we do now,,,
3,big-al-pizza_resized_1280-720,6:16,6:45,and after that there was an ad of like how two friends were just chilling and they wanted to eat pizza and instead of ordering weird al's pizza the guy placed an order big no big al's pizza he got an order from big owl's pizza so an owl came to deliver pizza and nobody was happy um which made me want pizza,,,

3,cecil-myers_resized_1280-720,7:35,8:19,um what was the ad after that one it didn't fit I thought whatever it was I'm gonna think for a second if there were any ads I missed oh yeah there was that ad with like the guy with the big heart which is just like this mock music video situation with a lot of people in it I don't really know what the ad was for except for the guy who was just the owner of the store or something with a big heart a guy with a big cecil a guy with a big heart um more ads,,,
