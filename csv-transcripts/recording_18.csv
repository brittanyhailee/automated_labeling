1,corner-gas,0:07,0:26,"um, so uh in terms of the first clip that I saw was from the show basically about the people in a small town dog river there's only one gas station in the town and there's two police officers that work in the town um and in the first clip"
1,corner-gas,0:27,0:54,"they were basically trying to um because something new came in or like renovation or something like that um and they were brainstorming ways they wanted to retaliate against I believe it was like the dog river tavern or haven dog river haven um and they were brainstorming ideas trying to throw like watermelons and different things like that on the door and then like smashing the person, not slashing the tires but putting like knives in the tires um they were doing a brainstorming session with that "
1,corner-gas,0:56,1:00,and I believe the commercial that was paired with that
1,crazy-gideons,1:00,1:10,was the commercial that was with the guy that was selling TVs and uh for like low low prices and camcorders and dvds so that was the commercial that was paired with that clip
1,corner-gas,1:11,1:32,"um, the second clip from that show was the owner of that gas station um the protagonist of that show I forgot the name of the show but he was putting up a poster saying that they now sell uh video or they're selling like you know DVDs VCR where you can buy videos from them and the guy comes in and he's outraged by that"
1,corner-gas,1:32,1:38,and he's like what's next is there going to be a waterpark in here or like what is the what is the story with that 
1,go-wireless,1:38,1:46,um then the commercial that was paired with that one was the phone commercial where they were selling phones um so that was it for that commercial
1,the-riches,1:46,1:58,um and then another commercial was from that show I can't remember the name of this one either but it was the show where like something about a car accident um and then like the family assumes the identity of the rich family 
1,the-riches,1:58,2:02,and so the first clip from that show
1,the-riches,2:02,2:11,um was uh it was this man and he was looking like it was like a dark space and he was looking at another man with a flashlight
1,ieuter-secor_insurance,2:11,2:17,um then I believe the commercial that was paired with that one was one about um 
1,ieuter-secor_insurance,2:17,2:21,it was one about like calling a lawyer or like a disaster thing 
1,ieuter-secor_insurance,2:21,2:26,um and then you know kind of like you need insurance
1,ieuter-secor_insurance,2:26,2:36,um and then after that the next clip that I remember um it was the one where the the last the most recent one or the last one that I saw 
1,the-riches,2:36,2:50,um and they were going into like a hospital setting um and it was an elderly woman that was laying down and I think it was the relation she was the grandmother and they asked her you know they were like the doctor asked like has she been drinking
1,the-riches,2:50,2:59,um because she reeks of alcohol and and they were like no but then you know some more like the doctor spoke they were like we don't know to our recollection
1,eagle-insurance,2:59,3:08,um and then the connection with that uh like the commercial that was paired with that um was the car commercial about like do you have insurance
1,eagle-insurance,3:08,3:17,um and like basically the last one was like a giant um I don't know I believe like a chicken or a like a giant thing came from the sky
1,eagle-insurance,3:18,3:23,and then uh like a baby duckling hatched from the egg and it showed like the low low deals for insurance and that's what i remember
2,Fillmore,0:03,0:10,ok so um the two clips that I um that I um that are from this round are from the show Fillmore and then the other show
2,Fillmore,0:10,0:21,and then the other show about um the kids and then basically all the adults got killed in some type of apocalyptic event so for the first clip it was um
2,Fillmore,0:21,0:49,it was Fillmore and Anev his partner in crime and they were meeting with the principal and the principal was informing them um that there was an issue because um basically like there's um every school is like known for something um and their school is known for someone having like I forgot the name of like the digital kinda like pet kinda like a Tomagotchi pet type of uh vibe um
2,Fillmore,0:49,0:57,and they kept it alive like all of this time uh but then someone stole it and like the pet is missing the digital pet is missing
2,Fillmore,0:57,1:08,um so she got basically Fillmore and Anev on the case um and the commercial that aired after that one
2,big-al_pizza,1:08,1:16,was um I believe it was one about pizza um and it was basically one just talking about pizza or something and then
2,Fillmore,1:16,1:36,the clip that came after that was another Fillmore clip and it was when um they go around to like get intel about who like could've taken the pet so they go to um basically they go to um the mom of all like this the student the mom of the student who owns the pet
2,Fillmore,1:36,1:47,and they kept it alive like all of this time uh but then someone stole it and like the pet is missing the digital pet is missing and they ask her like you know like uh some questions and they're like you know about the pet and she's like saying like you know who cares about that and they looked and are shocked
2,Fillmore,1:47,1:51,um and then I can't remember the commercial that was paired with that one um
2,the-tribe,1:51,1:59,but then after that it started off with the clip about the show with the kids and they're in the apocalypse like it's it's only kids left there's no more adults 
2,the-tribe,1:59,2:16,um and it's basically showing all of them and kind of like where they are like they are like kind of tribing becuase there's if I recall there's different tribes and so it's like that tribe of kids and they're like looking for Chloe I believe
2,cecil_mitsubishi,2:16,2:22,"um and then the one that aired after that was a car commercial um yeah that was a car commercial,"
2,the-tribe,2:22,2:34,um and then after that it was another clip about still relating to that show with the kids and they have no more adults left um so it was ok it was that and then
2,the-tribe,2:34,3:00,uh the clip with that one was oh it was um a girl was in the car crying about someone named Gio and the guy next to her the kid next to her he was basically saying that like Gio sacrificed like look at it like Gio sacrificed for them um and he wanted to be part of some other tribe like I guess a rival tribe I don't know what happened
2,the-tribe,3:00,3:07,um but that was basically the scene she was crying on his lap um about Gio um and everything like that
2,big-al_pizza,3:07,3:24,the commercial that aired after that I believe was about the owl pizza so the joke in that commercial was uh like they called for pizza but like he mis-said it and the owl came in um and then at the end of the commercial you're like it's not big owl it's big owl pizza
2,Fillmore,3:24,3:39,um and then after that there was another Fillmore clip and the Fillmore clip was basically like them again trying to get down and try to solve like whoever took this pet or whatever and come to find out at during the interview that um
2,Fillmore,3:39,3:56,um the 'cause it's like this girl and they're dance partners and he was basically hanging around with a C crew kind of like just like faux kind of like gambling with like these different kind of like pets and he gave their basically their entire stash for that
2,Fillmore,3:56,4:08,you know that being a part of that and so then the dance partner was outraged he holds kind of like a press conference to say like that one of you auditions for a new dance partner because of what he did
2,cecil_mitsubishi,4:08,4:20,and I believe after that it was like um it was like a it showed the Mitsubishi car dealership um and he was just basically saying how he felt um new cars everything like that
2,the-tribe,4:20,4:47,um and then the last clip that I remember it was coming back from that show about the only kids are left and you see a girl like with a baby calf and then you see her in a office I guess reminiscing about her parents because you see them in the frame like her family and then old stuff on a calendar that they had like written um like all the events and stuff like that coming up um and that's what I remember from this
3,popular,0:01,0:16,um so starting from the last clip in the last clip it was from the show popular um and basically it was like the internal thoughts of one of the girls the girl's birthday the brunette girl

3,Panam,0:44,1:16,uh going back to the first clip that I saw was from the show Panam like about the Panam stewardess um take um basically like she met with a guy and he's like a CIA agent and that was kind of like their first encounter they met in it looked like a restaurant or a bar um and he was basically telling her that she perfect for being like undercover because she's trilingual um you know she's beautiful can fly under the radar um but also be able to do the things for the government
3,village-inn_restaurant,1:20,1:36,and the commercial that was paired with that was the one about like it was like a family buffet and it was like a a girl like a little girl basically saying that when she grows up that she and and then you show shots of like the buffet and like the different foods there and it's like southern cuisine 
3,Panam,1:36,2:01,the next clip was also I believe from the show about the the Panam stewardess and it was basically like her first assignment and it's her it's him buying it's him at the counter buying a magazine that has the Panam stewardess featured and he basically gives her the instructions of like she needs to slip into like someone's bag and different things like that I can't remember the commercial that was paired with that one
