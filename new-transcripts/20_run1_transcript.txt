00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:21.660
Okay, so, um, one of the shows shown was a cartoon
one with the two kids. I think one is a Cornelia

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:30.580
something and the girl and they're recruited by
their principal at school to find someone who

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:41.280
stole something, I think. And they like suspected
this one guy who kind of confesses to possibly

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:47.480
being at the site of the scene or around it. And his
girlfriend is like so surprised because she's

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:53.720
like, how did you hang out with those people? And
then she makes this like public announcement at

00:00:53.720 --> 00:01:07.440
school, I guess, that, um, that like she's looking
for like a new boyfriend. And also that show is

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:14.820
interesting because the two kids also went to this
like blonde ladies house. And  like these two young

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:23.760
students seem like they went to like an adult
person's house to like question them. Let's see

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:36.720
there's a commercial off just around then about
like, if you have problems with, I think it's like

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:45.800
bugs if you have like pest problems. One of the
commercials was about firecrackers and like

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:53.360
being able to buy explosives. It was seems like
kind of like a warehouse  Costco  kind of like store

00:01:53.360 --> 00:02:03.800
and like women had like the words boom, boom or
something else like on shorts on their bottoms.

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:14.820
And they're like shaking them for the television.
There was the one about Owl's Pizza, but the person

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:23.800
mistakenly called Owl's Pizza like a bird and then
a bird flew in with pizza, I think. There's

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:34.800
something, some sort of like square object. There
was the Mitsubishi ad where this car dealer's

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:45.740
rapping about the deals as well as another rap ad
where some guys are rapping about like pain. The

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:52.600
pain is like a hotline I guess or like some sort of
service they can get to go to for like any pain they

00:02:52.600 --> 00:03:01.460
have. It's weird because they're like most all the
people who are rapping were black but then the

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:11.880
person in the like image of the person in pain or
injured was a white person. The other show shown

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:20.840
was The Tribe I believe where it's like post
apocalyptic where all the like adults are gone and

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:28.900
it's all these kids like trying to make alliances.
And so it's hard to like understand the

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:35.480
relationships but I know one of them I remember
like the scene in the car and then also the scene at

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:36.665
like the playground. 

00:04:01.833 --> 00:04:05.269
That's basically what I remember.
