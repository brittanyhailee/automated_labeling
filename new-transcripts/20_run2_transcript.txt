00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:16.620
Okay, so one of the TV show shown was Pan Am a TV
show about the stewardesses, and he is also like

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:28.980
undercover as a CIA agent. The first clip seems to
be like her talking with someone in like a cafe, and then

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:40.380
when she's getting, when she's in the airport, like
ready to board a flight, she's given a box that must

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:47.100
be something that she's supposed to plant on
somewhere or something like that. And as part of

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:53.900
her job as an agent, and so then she's on the plane
and is supposed to do that. She's like all nervous

00:00:53.900 --> 00:01:01.920
about having to do that. It seems like also other
stewardesses are aware of what she's like are suspicious

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:07.740
of, that she's acting different and doing things
that aren't part of her job description as a

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:15.660
stewardess. And then another scene from that show
is shown, or it's like the two stewardesses who's

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:24.940
like in a relationship with the pilot, and they
must have made some form of agreement where he was

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:35.240
like, oh you can drive my really cool car. And so,
yeah, they're all nice and dressed up, and he's

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:40.860
like super excited to drive his car, and he's like,
oh where's your license? You have a license,

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:48.340
right? And she's like, oh what license? And smiles
like cheekily, and then they drive off and put your stuff

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:59.120
in the back, etc. And let's see, another show that
was shown was the one where I think it's two girls. I

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:08.979
think they're sisters, and one is blonde, and one
is dark haired, and like brunette. And the brunette

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:14.640
one is supposed to, like the blonde one is supposed
to have like perfect, all together, like has it

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:22.300
all together, or like more popular, and I think the
brunette one just has a different, less known

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:34.080
friend group. And the, there's one scene where
they're like walking through the hallways, or the

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:40.500
brunette is walking through the hallways with her
other friend, and she's like, turns to her friend,

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:44.000
like of high school, walking through the hallways
of high school, and she turns to her other friend,

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.700
and she's like, why is everyone looking at me? Like
do I have something stuck in my teeth or something?

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:55.520
And then she gets to her locker, and it says
something about a lapdog, and implying that I

00:02:55.520 --> 00:03:00.240
guess she's like, for promiscuous? I don't know, I guess
she would give lap dances to people, at least

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:09.620
that's what one other male student insinuates
when he talks to her after seeing her locker. And

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:18.340
then there's also, I think, I think it's a third
show, where it's like a bunch of girls, two that

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:26.320
are teenagers, and I remember like one scene where
they're all in a bedroom together, and they're

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:31.400
like talking about beauty standards, or like, you
know, just one main character's kind of like

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:38.970
narrating the scene, or like how they're like, how this
one girl who's more overweight and not as confident in

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:48.330
her body and then there's other girls who's
stereotypically thin but also has a bigger chest.

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:56.310
In terms of the commercials, there was the rug one
where the guy's in the middle of a lake or something

00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:03.630
on a rug and falls into the water and then he's
somehow floating on a rug too at some point.

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:18.350
There's two laws, like ones about legal services,
one is for relationship problems or something

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:28.630
like that and two people who are in a bicker full
kind of marriage are sitting on a couch watching

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:34.390
this commercial for the lawyer that they should
call. So they have a little argument over the

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:39.770
remote and then seeing this commercial, this guy
saying like, oh, if your marriage is bad or

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:47.330
something like that, call me so then they raise to
the phone. And then there's another commercial

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:56.070
that's, oh, it's like a bankruptcy, like if you're
in bankruptcy, call this service and they'll help

00:04:56.070 --> 00:05:10.550
you. So, um, then there's, oh, there's a perfume
one about a woman who was like, oh, perfume for all,

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:17.650
I think the perfume started with a C, it was in a
yellow, yellow bottle and it was like perfume for

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:24.990
all of your, like, different versions of
yourself. And then there was also the commercial

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:31.510
for beer and so of course that one was for men and not
women and they're like sitting on a beach or

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:40.130
something and they like tossed a beach ball
towards the people who are walking toward them.

00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:52.970
But they're on this like very rocky, like kind of
California, cloudy beach, I don't know. And, um,

00:05:52.970 --> 00:06:13.770
and, um, oh, the one in the beginning was the female,
there was like a young girl talking about how she

00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:25.130
wanted to open up or like, open up. Like, like her
dream was to open up a, like, a restaurant or was

00:06:25.130 --> 00:06:31.430
like a bed, a bed and breakfast, but it was like also
like the village kind of place where you can like

00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:39.470
go, eat, hang out, I guess, I don't know. And have
like shots of yummy food and she's like, yeah, this

00:06:39.470 --> 00:06:49.070
is so great. And then there's also the sushi
commercial for a sushi place in New Jersey. It

00:06:49.070 --> 00:06:54.750
seemed kind of like offensive, this commercial, I
don't know, this is like white guy just like

00:06:54.750 --> 00:07:06.370
yapping on about like Japanese sushi and about
like delivery and that they have delivery. That's

00:07:06.370 --> 00:07:06.650
all I remember.
