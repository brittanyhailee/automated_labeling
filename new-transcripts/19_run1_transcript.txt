00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:24.400
Do I just say what I remember? Okay, I think they
were mostly clips of the Pan Am show and the teen

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:32.640
drama. I think like I forgot what the first clip of
the Pan Am was but it's followed by the commercial

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:41.640
with the blonde girl. I don't remember what it was
advertising. I think the next clip was the older

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:49.100
sister from Pan Am was being given a password to,
or like a fake password to just slip into some of

00:00:49.100 --> 00:01:00.260
these bags. I don't remember what the commercial
was. Then there was the blonde girl was in the

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:07.820
bathroom. I don't remember what the commercial
came up to that. Then there was a clip of the

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:13.480
dark-haired girl and she was with her friend and
there was something written on the locker about

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:28.780
being a lap dog. Then there was the clip from Pen-Am
about some French woman was in a car with a pilot, I

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:39.120
think. And she drives the car and I think the
commercial after that was the sushi place. Yeah, I

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:48.320
think that's what I remember. Oh, there was a clip
of the two sisters from Pen-Am with their mother

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:56.680
was on the plane and I think the commercial after
was for the photography. And then there was

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:05.540
another clip of the teen show where they were out of
sleep over and they were thinking different

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:13.780
things. And I think it was, well, one of the teen
shows was followed by an ad where the guy was in the

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:19.620
car and the cop called him cool. And another clip of
the teen show was followed by that beer ad on the

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:22.600
beach. I think that's all I remember.
