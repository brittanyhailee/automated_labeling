00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:15.660
So the last commercial was about a furniture
store advertising. This guy was showing all the

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:24.657
deals, he was dressed in an astronaut NASA suit and
he was like beaming like different items or people.

00:00:28.753 --> 00:00:36.065
In the beginning, there was a commercial about this
guy who was super excited practically yelling about

00:00:36.065 --> 00:00:49.300
all the things about all the types of technologies 
he sells in a store like video cameras, laptops, that sort of thing. 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:01:01.280
Another commercial was about cell phones, yeah like
selling cell phones and wireless cell phones. And

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:16.500
then there's a commercial about the thing that
goes through the snow when they sit on like an

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:27.860
electric sled, I don't know, I don't know if that's
the right word. Something like that, but I think

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:33.260
the guy was saying, I think it's a Heindl or
something like that, Heindl, sleds, and ski

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:44.820
something. And it was so popular that people were
naming their child Heindl after the company, 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:53.660
their dog Heindl, and they were like, oh, there's a
insurance one, or it's like people are calling in

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:58.760
with different problems that they're having or
things that they would need insurance coverage

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:05.020
for, and then like insurance people were
answering and like responding directly to like

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:15.000
all these different issues and all their claims.
Sounds nice in theory. And then there was the one

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:21.520
with like in the car where the girl hit someone,
there were two girls in the car, the driver hit one

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:26.980
of the parked cars I think while she was parking or
something like that, and her friend in the

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:35.560
passenger seat was like, do you have insurance?
And they get out and there's like a mascot eagle

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:42.540
lays an egg on the top of the car and out of the egg
comes a lottery ticket, and they're like, oh my

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:47.560
goodness, I have this money, because I
don't have insurance, but if we win, like that

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:59.060
would be great, and everything's fine now. And
then, let's see, oh there was the rapping, there

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:04.980
was like two women going through a fabric store,
one was like pushing the shopping cart. The other

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:13.190
commercial is in the shopping cart and they're
just like saying or singing or rapping about the

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:29.470
like store and the things, the fabric that they
sell. Um, any other commercials? Um, okay. Okay,

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:37.150
and then the TV show, uh, there was the detective
one. It's hard to tell or like piece any of that

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:45.290
together too well, but it seems like the first
scene, the detective discovers a dead body with

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:52.390
all this money. Actually, I don't know if it's a
detective or not. But yeah, there's this like, uh,

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:58.390
old man, and he's like bleeding out and dead and
that's five comments and like starts, I guess he's

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:07.030
not a detective because he took all his money. So,
seems like he's a bad guy. Um, and there's scenes

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:13.690
like a gas station for that or like, it seems like
two different parties are kind of like meeting up

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:21.829
or kind of notice each other while they're pumping
gas. One of them is, there's a scene inside one of

00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:28.370
the trailers. Uh, there's a scene in the house with
that really famous guy with Southern accent,

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:33.930
where he seems happy about how things were like
going with their little mission on whatever is

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:43.210
happening. Uh, and then the other video or TV show
was the gas station one where it's like a really

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:51.070
small town and the guy who owns the gas station. Uh,
that was everyone's business, it seems. Um, you

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:58.890
know, like there's one scene where two of his
parents are like arguing about something and, um,

00:04:58.890 --> 00:05:06.610
they're arguing over a customer who's there,
like, can I just get gas? He tells his parents to go

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:14.450
sort it out somewhere else. Um, there's a scene in
the, um, in the convenience store, the store of the

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:21.610
gas station where, um, they're like, once the
guy's like hanging up a poster and the girl's like,

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:26.390
it's crooked or something like that and he's like,
maybe I'm just like, crooked all the time. And

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:32.570
then, uh, there's also like this lady who comes in,
who seems to be out of town, from out of town, like

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:39.610
describing things that happened to her, possibly
like her tires were slashed and like something was

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:44.886
egged, uh, watermelons were being thrown. Um,
and... 

00:06:04.218 --> 00:06:06.718
Yep, I think that's all I remember.
