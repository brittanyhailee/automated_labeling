00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:15.760
There were, it started with the Fillmore show
where the principal was asking them to find some

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:23.580
Tamagotchi thing. The next clip, they went to the
mother of the owner of the Tamagotchi who was kind

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:31.100
of dismissive of what they were doing. I don't
remember the commercials. And then it was the show

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:37.460
where all the adults died out and they were on a
playground. And then the next clip, the same show,

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:43.160
they were in a car, there were three of them, and one
of them had just sacrificed himself and the girl

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:52.200
was sad about it. And I think that ad after that or
before it was the rap song with the blue

00:00:52.200 --> 00:01:05.560
background. And then there was an ad about
fireworks. Then more of the Fillmore show where one of

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:15.480
the kids was gambling something, his dance
partner owned. And there was a bowling ad, I think,

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:21.340
after that. And there was a following of the same
clip where the dance partner had a press conference and

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:31.360
her partnership. Then after that there was the
pizza place with the owl ad. And then there were

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:43.040
more clips about the show with the adults gone. 
I forgot what happened

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:49.980
in the first clip, but then I think the ad after that
was about a car sale. And then after that, oh no, the

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:59.220
show before the car sale, there was a girl with a cow
in the car sale ad. And then the clip with a sick girl

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:06.040
being tended to by someone, I guess she was
pregnant or something, she had a baby. And the ad

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:13:231
after that was about a Chinese buffet, I think. And
that was all of it.
