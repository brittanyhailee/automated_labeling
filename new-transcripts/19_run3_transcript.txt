00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:11.040
These were clips from the gas station comedy and
the riches show that started with, they were at the

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:16.780
gas station comedy and they were talking about
something and they were dropping eggs and melons

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:27.020
and everything and then the ad after that I think
was the electronic store or crazy something and

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:31.500
then was the gas station show, they were hanging
out the poster about movies because they were

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:39.400
selling or renting movies, the old guy didn't
like that and then the next show there was a man

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:50.660
opening a safe and an old man holding a bell. I think
there's, I don't remember the ad. The next one, the

00:00:50.660 --> 00:01:00.620
dad from the riches I think was with a blonde guy
also talking about something I don't remember. I

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:11.460
think after that was the car ad with the blonde lady
and they're going not this model, that model. Then

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:19.320
they were two of the gas station clips and there
was someone wanting a stand mixer and a motor for a

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:27.040
boat and there was a comedic bit about that. I think
after that there was the eagle insurance

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:37.843
commercial and then more clips of the riches show
and I yeah that's all I remember.
