In the first clip of Pan Am, we saw the sister Kate going on a date with the CIA agent and he was telling her she would make a good CIA informant slash helper and then we saw him giving her something to put to switch out with somebody's passport I think and then we saw her on the plane with her sister and their mom was on the plane and one of the commercials we saw after that was for the divorce ad and then we also saw a sushi commercial for a sushi restaurant after Pan Am and in the popular clips the step sister Brooke.

She was feeling stressed in the bathroom with her friend and her friend offered her something to help with the anxiety like Xanax or Prozac and she refused.

I think there were more food commercials after that, and there was one about debt, where the guy, there was fire behind him, and he was talking about some type of installment plan that people can pay when they file bankruptcy.
