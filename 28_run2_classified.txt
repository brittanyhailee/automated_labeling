So the first clip was the Fillmore and Third and in the opening scene   they're talking with the principal of the school and the principal's like, oh, you guys are awesome.
	-predicted class: fillmore_ep-7_236-406_part1_resized_1280-720

They're like, thanks, And then she's like alright, let's get to the chase.
	-predicted class: popular_ep-04_1332-1502_part2_resized_1280-720

We are supposed to have this news crew come in and interview a student who's kept one of those virtual pets alive for four years.
	-predicted class: fillmore_ep-7_236-406_part2_resized_1280-720

However, it's been lost and Fillmore and Third are like, oh my gosh, we should help find that.
	-predicted class: fillmore_ep-7_236-406_part2_resized_1280-720

And then the principal's like, yeah, I know, because we have the news crew coming in.
	-predicted class: popular_ep-04_1332-1502_part2_resized_1280-720

They're like, well, also because the kid lost his virtual pet.
	-predicted class: fillmore_ep-7_236-406_part2_resized_1280-720

She's like, ah, yeah, that too.
	-predicted class: popular_ep-05_2131-2308_part2_resized_1280-720

And then she's like, anything you can do, do it.
	-predicted class: popular_ep-04_1332-1502_part1_resized_1280-720

And then Fillmore's like, Fillmore's like, can we get a name?
	-predicted class: fillmore_ep-7_236-406_part2_resized_1280-720

And then the guy gives, there's like a guard, sort of guard in the room.
	-predicted class: adopt-a-pet_resized_1280-720

And the guard gives him, gives the kids the name of the kid.
	-predicted class: popular_ep-04_1332-1502_part2_resized_1280-720

The commercial.
	-predicted class: go-wireless_resized_1280-720

I am forget.
	-predicted class: popular_ep-04_1332-1502_part2_resized_1280-720

The next TV clip was the same, I'm pretty sure it was just a continuation of the same show, same scene.
	-predicted class: corner-gas_s1-ep1_636-805_part2_resized_1280-720

And so they show the kid third and Fillmore show up to the house of the parent of the kid who lost the virtual pet.
	-predicted class: fillmore_ep-7_236-406_part2_resized_1280-720

And they're like, hey, we're here to investigate the case of the lost pet.
	-predicted class: fillmore_ep-7_236-406_part2_resized_1280-720

And the mom is like, I don't know why you're worried because of a little pet.
	-predicted class: the-tribe_episode-6_645-815_part2_resized_1280-720

And then they're like, excuse me.
	-predicted class: popular_ep-04_1332-1502_part2_resized_1280-720

And then it gets to the commercial.
	-predicted class: go-wireless_resized_1280-720

And then later there is the post-apocalypse TV show.
	-predicted class: fillmore_ep-7_236-406_part2_resized_1280-720

And there's kids and they're like, there's Chloe.
	-predicted class: the-tribe_episode-1_1202-1332_part-1_resized_1280-720

And Chloe apparently is in another room next to them.
	-predicted class: popular_ep-05_2131-2308_part1_resized_1280-720

And is among several kids and a dog playing on a slide on the playground.
	-predicted class: the-tribe_episode-1_1202-1332_part-1_resized_1280-720

Just messing around and kind of like a torn down but still functional playground That is followed by, or later there's a scene with the post-apocalypse kids in a car.
	-predicted class: the-tribe_episode-1_1202-1332_part-1_resized_1280-720

And it's like a boy and a girl in the backseat and they're talking about something heavy.
	-predicted class: corner-gas_s2-ep1_805-935_part2_resized_1280-720

And the guy is questioning something, asking questions of the girl.
	-predicted class: popular_ep-04_1332-1502_part1_resized_1280-720

And then nothing happens.
	-predicted class: popular_ep-04_1332-1502_part2_resized_1280-720

Then the guy in the front seat is trying to jump start the car.
	-predicted class: panam_s01ep02_316-359_resized_1280-720

And he says he can't because there's no gas in the car.
	-predicted class: panam_s01ep02_316-359_resized_1280-720

Then he offers some sort of gum to the guys in the backseat but then can't.
	-predicted class: panam_s01ep02_316-359_resized_1280-720

They're like okay.
	-predicted class: corner-gas_s2-ep1_805-935_part1_resized_1280-720

After the very first TV show the commercial was two guys I think, two little people and they were making a sandwich and we need to get an ingredient and then they go and get the ingredient and while that happens they the same guys dressed as ants and go and steals the sandwich and like they carry off the sandwich and they're in a procession with a bunch of sandwich ingredients for the sandwich and then the guys returning as their human selves are like, where's the sandwich?
	-predicted class: area-wide-exterminators_resized_1280-720

And then they look and they see that the ants stole them and then it's like, have bug problems?
	-predicted class: popular_ep-04_1332-1502_part2_resized_1280-720

call this number and that's that the commercial.
	-predicted class: go-wireless_resized_1280-720

There's another post apocalypse TV scene where, which is just like one of the kids, there's like a kid leading a cow to a refrigerator full of grass and then she's like, hey, eat this grass.
	-predicted class: the-tribe_episode-6_645-815_part1_resized_1280-720

Then she looks up and sees kind of a police officer looking person like walking away and she gets scared and tells the cow, hey, let's walk away.
	-predicted class: the-tribe_episode-6_645-815_part1_resized_1280-720

And then then it cuts to a scene to the scene where there's like a kid just kind of walking around, what I presume is like their parent's office and kind of just like looking at it, smelling their clothes, looking at pictures.
	-predicted class: the-tribe_episode-6_645-815_part1_resized_1280-720

That cuts to a commercial for China Star Buffet, which is like a guy, starts off a guy like walking, kind of Godzilla style over a prop town.
	-predicted class: china-star-delicious_resized_1280-720

He's like, I'm big and so is my appetite and therefore I need a lot of food.
	-predicted class: china-star-delicious_resized_1280-720

Let's go to China Star and he starts describing the China Star food and how big it is and then he starts riding crab legs, which there's a disclaimer that's like, oh, you can't actually ride these crab legs.
	-predicted class: china-star-delicious_resized_1280-720

Then he starts eating like, you know, like you can eat all this food, it's great value.
	-predicted class: village-inn-family-buffet_resized_1280-720

And at the end, he starts playing the guitar, he's like, don't put the food blues, eat a China Star or something like that.
	-predicted class: china-star-delicious_resized_1280-720

And then there's another commercial where there's two guys and they're rapping and they're like rapping about a car accident that they had, but then they were saying like, oh, if you, but then we went to Arrowhead Clinic and that got us better really quick.
	-predicted class: arrowhead-clinic_resized_1280-720

So you should call this number, there's like 770-961-PAIN, something like that, which maybe think of T-PAIN.
	-predicted class: arrowhead-clinic_resized_1280-720

And then there's like a baby, or like not a baby, but like a toddler kind of like dressed up to look cool, like with sunglasses and he was like doing a little dance at some point in that commercial.
	-predicted class: cecil-myers_resized_1280-720
